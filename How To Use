# How To Use

*** This is a very simple todo application. I built this on Django using function based view.
To use it, all you need do is to type into the input box your task for the day.
You can see the delete and update buttons. Those are to help delete and update you task.
When you click on update, you will see a completion chechbox. Click is to strike a partiular
task to show you have completd that task.
